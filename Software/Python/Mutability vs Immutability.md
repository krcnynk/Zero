Every object has (not variable/the box)
1. Value (42)
2. Identity (4323663453)
3. Type (float)

Mutable: change value without changing identity
Immutable: change value will change identity


Immutable:
	Strings: "asd" or 'asd'
	Tuples: (1,2,3) ordered
Mutable:
	List [1,2,3] ordered
	Dictionary {key:value} ordered
	Sets {1,2,3} unordered (can appear different order, cannot be indexed/keyed)

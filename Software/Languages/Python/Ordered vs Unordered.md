# Ordered vs Unordered

**Ordered data types** maintain the order of elements as they are added. This means that when you iterate over these data structures, elements will be returned in the order in which they were inserted.

###### list, tuples, strings, ordered dictionaries, ranges

**Unordered data types** do not maintain the order of elements. When you iterate over these data structures, the order of elements may not be the same as the order in which they were added.

###### sets, dictionary, frozenset

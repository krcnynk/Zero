Null Hypothesis (the one you want to reject)
Alternative (the on you are testing)

One Tailed Z Test (population mean test)
Random sample IQ shows mean score of 120
Null hypothesis: accepted fact mean score is 100
Alternate Hypothesis: mean IQ is > 100 (one tailed test)
Draw the graph
Alpha level state (0.05 regular) -> will give rejection region
Find Z-score formula
Compare  Z-score > Rejection region, reject Null

Small p value -> observed outcome is unlikely under null hypothesis (does not mean null is false)
Large p value -> null hypothesis cannot be rejected at that significance level (does not mean null is true)

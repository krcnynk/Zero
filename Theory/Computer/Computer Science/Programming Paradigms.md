# Programming Paradigms

## Imperative Programming**

**Key Concepts**:

- **State**: Variables and memory are used to maintain and modify the state.
- **Control Structures**: Includes loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `switch`), and assignments.

## Procedural Programming

**Key Concepts**:

- **Procedures/Functions**: Blocks of code that perform tasks.
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into functions or procedures that can be reused and maintained independently.

## OOP

**Key Concepts**:

- **Classes and Objects**: Classes define types, and objects are instances of classes.
- **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are bundled into objects, hiding the internal state.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods can be overridden to provide specific implementations.

## Functional Programming

**Key Concepts**:

- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed once created.
- **Pure Functions**: Functions that have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions.

## Declarative Progrraming

**Key Concepts**:

- **Data Querying**: In SQL, you specify what data to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it.
- **Markup Languages**: HTML and CSS describe the structure and style of documents without defining the logic.

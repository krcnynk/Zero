# Stack

#### Function Calls

Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created. This frame includes:

- **Local Variables**: Storage for variables declared within the function.
- **Return Address**: The address to return to after the function completes.
- **Function Parameters**: Space for arguments passed to the function.
- **Saved Registers**: If necessary, the values of registers are saved and restored.

Exception Handling stack frames will be unwound if caught
In multithreading each thread will have its own stack

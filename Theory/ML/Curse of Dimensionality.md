# Curse of Dimensionality

Algorithms start to not work because in high dimensional spaces data points become sparse, hard to find meaningful patterns.
Most of the high-dimensional space is empty
Lets say 10 data points for a given feature and you have k binary features `2^k * 10` required data exponentially increases

Leads to longer training time, and overfitting
Feature selection and extraction (PCA) needed
Normalization
